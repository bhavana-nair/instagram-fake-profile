# Socialmedia Fake Profile Detection

Detecting fake profiles on social media platforms using machine learning techniques. 
This is an AI project to predict if a given account is legit or a fake given some characters of an account. These characters could be statuses count, followers count or friends count, which would help us differentiate a fake account from a legit account. These characters form the training features in a machine learning model.
Social media platforms have seen a rise in the number of fake profiles, which can be used for various malicious purposes. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect and classify fake profiles on social media platforms based on various features.

Data taken from this project https://github.com/LeadingIndiaAI/Detecting-Fake-Profiles-On-Social-Media (code is not same). Load the data set and process it. Preparing quality data could take some time, depending on our experience with ML datasets and depending on the task we are planning to do. But it is always worthy to invest time as goos data helps us gain better results and give better idea about the hyper parameters.
